Computer Science
	- Problem solving
	- Thinking methodically / correctly / precisely
	- Think like programmer / computer scientist
	
	Input -> Problem Solving -> Output
	
Languages Computer Speaks:
	- Binary (0 and 1)
	- but able to perform many tasks
	
	000 
	001
	010
	011
	100
	101
	110
	111
	
	- Binary very simple to represent
	- on / off state
	- high / low state
	etc.
	
	Can have many switches either on or off
	- then can start counting using many switches
	


000 = 2^2 2^1 2^0 = 4 2 1


4 2 1
1 1 1 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7


How can computer do much more than counting? (Representing information using Binary)

	- represent characters using numbers
	- ASCII initially (each character has a number assigned)
		- Limitation of 256 characters
		
		- H : 72 = 0100 1000
		- I : 73 = 0100 1001
		etc.
			- ASCII chart exists
		- to represent HI, require 16 bits ( 2 bytes )
		- 1 byte = 8 bits
			
	- unicode-8 (UTF-8) newer standard
		- more characters possible
		- 32 bits : 4 billion possible chars
	
	
	
	
- File formats define what each character is represented by
	.jpg
	.txt
	.xlsx
	.cpp
	- to allow computer to  distinguish between number 2 and character "2"
	
	
How computer represent colors?

	- RGB values (primary colors)
	- R : 0 to 255
	- G : 0 to 255
	- B : 0 to 255
	
	(R, G, B) = (0, 0, 255) = totally Blue
	(72, 73, 33) : olive like color
	
	Pixel: small square grid on screen
	- each pixel consist of 24 bits (8 bits per color)


Video?
	- A sequence of images across time
		- 30 frames per second (30 images per second)
		- 60 frames per second
		
		
Audio?
	- eg: midi format 
	
	numbers representing:
		- notes / duration / volume
